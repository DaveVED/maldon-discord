## ⇁ Contribution

We're excited to announce that this project is now officially open source, which 
means we're not just allowing access to the source code but are actively 
inviting contributions from the community. If you're interested in 
contributing, here's how to get started:

1. ***Start with an Issue*** with an Issue: Before making any changes, please open an issue to 
discuss your proposed contribution. This helps us coordinate efforts 
and ensure that your work aligns with the project's goals and current priorities.
Pull Requests (PRs): Once there's agreement on the issue you're addressing, feel free to submit a pull request. We're open to PRs, but please note that we adopt a conservative approach to merging them. Our focus is on maintaining the project's generality and utility. We aim for contributions that enhance the project for everyone, rather than addressing highly specific use cases.

1. ***Fork vs. Clone***: If you have a particular use case that requires 
modifications not generally applicable to the community, 
we recommend forking the repository. This allows you to tailor the project 
to your specific needs without diverging from the project's core focus. 
For general contributions, cloning the repository and creating a branch 
for your work is the way to go. This approach is better suited for 
contributions intended for the broader user base.
